# ReminderApp

An anniversary reminder application usuing C 

This Calendar is a simple program that allows the users to add or delete different events during the year.
The users can then review all the events added by them. When the users want to add an event, they will be
first asked to add the date (dd/mm/yyyy) and then further add more details about the event itself (topic and description).
In order to delete an event, the users will have to select the “delete” option in the menu and then enter any keyword
about the event. If the keyword is found, then the user is given the choice to delete it.

this project is made by different header files which carry the functions for each part such as delete,search,calender,menu and so on and
it written using Code::Block IDE and cygwin64 compiler.
